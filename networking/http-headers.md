## Common Request Headers in REST:

- **Accept**: Specifies the media type(s) that the client is willing to receive from the server (e.g., application/json).
- **Accept-Encoding**: Indicates the content encoding (e.g., gzip) that the client can understand, allowing the server to compress the response if supported.
- **Accept-Language**: Specifies the preferred languages for the response (e.g., en-US).
- **Authorization**: Contains credentials for authenticating the client with the server (e.g., Bearer token).
- **Cache-Control**: Directives for caching mechanisms in both requests and responses (e.g., no-cache).
- **Cookies**: Contains stored cookies that the client sends to the server with the request.
- **Content-Length**: Indicates the size of the request body in bytes, allowing the server to know how much data to expect.
- **Content-Type**: Indicates the media type of the resource being sent to the server (e.g., application/json).
- **Connection**: Controls whether the network connection stays open after the current transaction finishes (e.g., keep-alive).
- **If-Modified-Since**: Used to make a conditional request, allowing the server to return a 304 Not Modified status if the resource has not changed since the specified date.
- **Host**: Specifies the domain name of the server and the port number (if applicable) to which the request is being sent.
- **Origin**: Indicates the origin of the request, used for CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) purposes.
- **Referer**: Provides the URL of the referring page that led to the request, which can be used for analytics and security purposes.
- **User-Agent**: Provides information about the client software making the request (e.g., browser type and version).

## Common Response Headers in REST:

- **Cache-Control**: Directives for caching mechanisms in both requests and responses (e.g., no-cache).
- **Clear-Site-Data**: Instructs the client to clear specific types of stored data (e.g., cookies, cache) for the site, enhancing security and privacy.
- **Content-Encoding**: Indicates the encoding used on the response body (e.g., gzip), allowing the client to decode the response correctly.
- **Content-Length**: Indicates the size of the response body in bytes, allowing the client
to know how much data to expect.
- **Content-Type**: Indicates the media type of the resource being returned by the server (e.g., application/json).
- **Date**: Provides the date and time at which the response was generated by the server.
- **ETag**: Provides a unique identifier for the specific version of the resource, allowing clients to make conditional requests based on the resource's state.
- **Last-Modified**: Indicates the date and time at which the resource was last modified, allowing clients to make conditional requests based on the resource's state.
- **Server**: Provides information about the server software handling the request (e.g., Apache, Nginx).
- **Set-Cookie**: Used by the server to send cookies to the client, which can be stored and sent back in subsequent requests.

## Security Headers

- **X-Powered-By**: This header is often used to indicate the technology stack used by the web server. However, it can also provide attackers with information about potential vulnerabilities in the server software. It is recommended to remove or obfuscate this header to prevent attackers from gaining insights into the server's technology.
- **Refferrer-Policy**: This header controls how much referrer information is sent with requests. It can help protect user privacy by limiting the amount of information shared with third-party websites. For example, setting it to "no-referrer" will prevent any referrer information from being sent.
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: This header is used to prevent MIME type sniffing, which can lead to security vulnerabilities. Setting it to "nosniff" tells the browser to strictly follow the declared content type and not attempt to guess the content type based on the content itself.
- **X-XSS-Protection**: This header is used to enable or disable the browser's built-in XSS protection. Setting it to "1; mode=block" will enable the protection and block any detected XSS attacks.
- **Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)**: This header is used to enforce secure connections by instructing the browser to only communicate with the server over HTTPS. It can help prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and ensure that sensitive data is transmitted securely.
