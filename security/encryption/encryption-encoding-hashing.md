## Encryption

Encryption involves transforming data into a secure format, ensuring only users with the correct key can retrieve the original data. It serves primarily to safeguard data during transmission or storage.

**Key Points:**
- Protects data confidentiality.
- Utilized in HTTPS for secure web communication.
- Prominent Algorithms: AES, RSA, Blowfish.

## Encoding

Encoding is the process of converting data to facilitate transfer between systems and applications. It maintains data integrity and usability and employs publicly available algorithms for conversion.

**Key Points:**
- Ensures data integrity during transmission.
- Algorithms publicly available for decoding.
- Prominent Algorithms: ASCII, UNICODE, URL Encoding, Base64.

## Hashing

Hashing is a one-way process where data is converted into a fixed-length alphanumeric string, known as a hash or message digest. It serves to verify data integrity, often used for checksum verification.

**Key Points:**
- Irreversible transformation.
- Ensures data integrity through checksum verification.
- Identical data produces identical hashes.
- Prominent Algorithms: MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256.
