# Types of Authentication

There are various authentication mechanisms, each with its own strengths and weaknesses

1. [Basic Authentication](#basic-authentication)
2. [Digest Authentication](#digest-authentication)
3. [Session Based Authentication](#session-based-authentication)
4. [Token Based Authentication](#token-based-authentication)
5. [OAuth (Open Authorization)](#oauth)
6. [OpenID Connect](#openid-connect)
7. [Certificate-Based Authentication](#certificate-based-authentication)
8. [LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)](#ldap)

## Basic Authentication

In Basic Authentication, client sends http request with <b>Authorization</b> header that contains base64 encoded string <i>usename:password</i> prefixed with Basic.

```
Authorization: Basic dXNlbmFtZTpwYXNzd29yZA==
```

##### PROS

- Easy to implement and widely supported.

##### CONS

- Credentials are sent in plaintext, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping.

## Digest Authentication

In Digest Authentication, the client sends the hashed user's credentials to the server. It applies MD5 cryptographic hashing and uses a nonce (a unique number used once) received from the server to prevent a replay attack. The server verifies the client's response by calculating the expected hash on its end. If the calculated hash matches the one received from the client, access is granted.

```
Authorization: Digest username="Alice", realm="Example Realm", nonce="dcd98b7102dd2f0e8b11d0f600bfb0c093", uri="/protected/resource", response="6629fae49393a05397450978507c4ef1", opaque="5ccc069c403ebaf9f0171e9517f40e41", qop=auth, nc=00000001, cnonce="0a4f113b"
```

- username="Alice": This is the username of the client (user).
- realm="Example Realm": The realm is a description of the protected area. It is used by the client and server to identify the authentication domain.
- nonce="dcd98b7102dd2f0e8b11d0f600bfb0c093": The nonce is a unique value generated by the server for each authentication request. It helps prevent replay attacks.
- uri="/protected/resource": The URI of the requested resource.
- response="6629fae49393a05397450978507c4ef1": This is the hashed response that the client generates based on the user's credentials, the nonce, and other parameters. It is not the plaintext password but a secure hash.
- opaque="5ccc069c403ebaf9f0171e9517f40e41": An opaque value that the client must return unchanged in subsequent requests. It doesn't contain the user's password.- - 
- qop=auth, nc=00000001, cnonce="0a4f113b": Quality of Protection (qop), nonce count (nc), and client nonce (cnonce) are additional parameters involved in the authentication process but do not include the user's password

##### PROS

- More secure than Basic Authentication as passwords are not sent in plaintext.

##### CONS

- Vulnerable to certain attacks like man-in-the-middle.
